# Agile for Volunteers Initiative

The Agile for Volunteers Initiative is a return to first principles focusing Whole Team efforts on Community Elevation Initiatives and Projects on the part of Volunteers contributing their time, effort, and expertise to these efforts using principles and methods born of the original [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](https://agilemanifesto.org/) and some of the fundamental views on these principles and methods that are team-oriented rather than business-oriented. Business is a part of the process, not the reason for it.

## Civic Volunteerism

Volunteers are already contributing their time, effort, and expertise when they participate in Initiatives and Projects focused on Community Elevation. These are typically Open Source software efforts, but they need not be limited to software efforts. Not everything is Code, not everything is an Application.

The goals of the founders of Agile were to make delivery of high quality outcomes (they referred to these as Software) and efficient use of the time, effort, and expertise of the Whole Team working toward these outcomes, the highest priorities. Communication and Iteration are key elements that aid both, we are focused on these and more to make the most of the contributions of Volunteers to efforts that can and will make a difference.

## Open Starting Point

The Agile for Volunteers Initiative is itself a Civic Volunteer Initiative, Open Source, and available for extension and re-consideration. As a starting point, this Initiative may be a basis for a particular cohort to craft a set of principles and methodologies which will work for their participants to make the most of their contributions.
